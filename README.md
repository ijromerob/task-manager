# Overview

I am writing this software to learn about Kotlin and the basic syntax that is used in this language. In this software the user is able to create different type of tasks. 
The different tasks are:
- Personal Tasks
- Professional Tasks
- Financial Tasks
- Creative Tasks

These tasks are children of a class Task.

The software displays the information of each task and changes the status of each one (completed or not).
